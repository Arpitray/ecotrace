# Plant Gallery Feature

## Overview
The gallery feature automatically saves plant identification results and displays them in a beautiful grid layout. Users can click on any saved plant to view its full details again.

## Architecture

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`lib/plantStorage.js`** - Local storage utility
   - `savePlantResult(plantData)` - Saves a plant identification to localStorage
   - `getPlantHistory()` - Retrieves all saved plants
   - `deletePlantResult(id)` - Removes a single plant
   - `clearPlantHistory()` - Clears all saved plants
   - Stores up to 50 most recent identifications

2. **`app/Gallery/page.jsx`** - Gallery page component
   - Grid layout displaying all saved plants
   - Shows plant image, name, timestamp, and confidence score
   - Click on card to view full plant details
   - Delete button (appears on hover) to remove plants
   - Empty state when no plants have been identified
   - Responsive design (1-4 columns based on screen size)

3. **`app/results/page.js`** - Updated to auto-save
   - Now imports `savePlantResult` from plantStorage
   - Automatically saves each plant identification when results are viewed
   - No user action required - happens automatically

4. **`app/Components/Profile.jsx`** - Updated navigation
   - Gallery menu item now clickable and navigates to `/Gallery`
   - Added `handleGalleryClick()` handler

## User Flow

1. **Upload & Identify**: User uploads a plant photo → AI identifies it
2. **View Results**: Results page displays → **Automatically saved to gallery**
3. **Access Gallery**: Click Profile dropdown → Gallery → View all saved plants
4. **Revisit Plants**: Click any gallery card → Navigate back to full results page
5. **Manage Collection**: Hover over cards → Delete button appears → Remove unwanted plants

## Data Structure

Each saved plant entry contains:
```javascript
{
  id: "timestamp-string",           // Unique identifier
  timestamp: "ISO-8601-datetime",   // When it was saved
  scientificName: "Plant Name",     // Scientific name
  commonNames: ["Common Name"],     // Array of common names
  family: "Family Name",            // Taxonomic family
  genus: "Genus Name",              // Taxonomic genus
  score: 0.95,                      // Confidence score (0-1)
  uploadedImage: "data:image/...",  // Base64 image data
  // Plus any additional fields from identification
}
```

## Storage

- **Current**: Browser localStorage (up to 50 plants)
- **Future**: Supabase database integration planned
  - Will migrate to server-side storage
  - Enable cross-device sync
  - Support unlimited plants
  - Add filtering/search capabilities

## Migration Path to Supabase

When ready to integrate Supabase:

1. Create `plant_identifications` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE plant_identifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  scientific_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  common_names TEXT[],
  family TEXT,
  genus TEXT,
  confidence_score DECIMAL,
  image_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

2. Update `lib/plantStorage.js`:
   - Replace localStorage calls with Supabase queries
   - Use `supabase.from('plant_identifications').insert()`
   - Use `supabase.from('plant_identifications').select()`
   - Maintain same function signatures for easy transition

3. Upload images to Supabase Storage bucket instead of base64

## Features

## Testing

To test the gallery feature:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Upload and identify a plant
3. View the results (automatically saved)
4. Click Profile → Gallery
5. Verify the plant appears in the grid
6. Click the plant card to navigate back to results
7. Hover and click delete to remove it

## Next Steps

- [ ] Integrate Supabase for persistent storage
- [ ] Add search/filter functionality
- [ ] Add sorting options (date, name, confidence)
- [ ] Add bulk delete option
- [ ] Add export gallery feature (PDF/CSV)
- [ ] Add plant comparison view
- [ ] Add notes/tags to saved plants
- [ ] Add sharing capabilities
